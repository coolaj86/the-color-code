               <b>HARTMAN PERSONALITY PROFILE</b><br/><br/>
<b>Part One:  Personality Strengths and Limitations</b><br/>
<i>Directions:</i>  Part One consists of 30 groups of descriptive words, with four words in each group.  Consider each group and mark only one word that best describes you <b>as a child</b>.   Your first impression of each word is usually the best.  For the most accurate assessment of your core personality, reflect back to your earliest recollections of yourself.  Try not to focus on how you want to behave or to be influenced by that person that you would like to become.

         <option category="red">Congratulations, your results indicate that your core color is Red and that you are motivated by Power.  The key to understanding your profile results is knowing that every individual is driven by a core motive.  That motive determines your behavior, including needs and wants, and why you behave the way you do.  The following information provides additional basic information about Reds.<br/><br/>
<b>RED</b><br/><br/>
MOTIVE:

<li>Power</li><br/>

NEEDS:

<li>To look good (academically)</li>
<li>To be right</li>
<li>To be respected</li>
<li>To receive selective approval</li><br/>

WANTS:

<li>To hide insecurities (tightly)</li>
<li>To please self</li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Challenging adventure</li><br/>

<br/>
To focus on the goal-setting strengths and limitations of Reds, study the following strengths/limitations list and the discussion that follows.<br/><br/>
<b>RED AS A GOAL SETTER</b><br/><br/>
_________________<br/><br/>
<b><i>Strengths</i></b>

<li>natural goal setter -- sets goals comfortably and confidently</li>
<li>maintains strong sense of perspective (sees the whole picture)</li>
<li>highly disciplined</li>
<li>highly productive with follow through</li>
<li>makes decisions quickly and easily</li>
<li>highly action-oriented and task dominant</li><br/>

<b><i>Limitations</i></b>

<li>impatient with self in completing goals</li>
<li>too rigid with expectations of his or her destiny</li>
<li>lives life on paper rather than with people</li>
<li>promotes quantity rather than quality</li>
<li>angered easily if goals aren't achieved or become blocked</li>
<li>blames others for personal misfortunes</li><br/>

_________________<br/><br/>

Because you are a natural goal setter, you can use your natural abilities in this area to get the most out of both your personal and professional life.  To further improve your goal-setting skills, consider the following suggestions:<br/><br/>

Using the acronym SMART, you can remember the components of a goal statement:<br/>

<li><b>S</b>pecific:  State exactly what you want to accomplish.</li>
<li><b>M</b>easurable:  State what you want to accomplish in measurable terms so you will know when you've reached the goal.  For example, you should avoid words like maximize or improve, or some, or try to do better, because you won't really know if and when you've reached your goal.</li>
<li><b>A</b>ction-oriented:  Describe the actions you will need to take in order to achieve your goal.</li>
<li><b>R</b>ealistic, yet challenging:  Choose motivating and stimulating goals that, when achieved, will give you a sense of pride and build your confidence.</li>
<li><b>T</b>imely:  If you say you would like to do something "someday," it will more than likely never happen.  If you say you will have the goal achieved by next Tuesday or some other specific time frame, you will be much more likely to reach your goal.</li>

<br/>

Here is an example of a SMART goal statement written by a full-time college student who lives in a dormitory on campus and has a part-time job:  <b>I will increase my savings account</b> (<i>specific</i>) <b>by depositing into my bank account</b> (<i>action-oriented</i>) <b>20 percent of my paycheck</b> (<i>measurable</i>) <b>beginning this Friday for the next eight weeks</b> (<i>timely</i>) <b>so I'll have enough money to pay for my auto insurance when it comes due</b> (<i>realistic, yet challenging</i>).<br/>


<li>If you become impatient with yourself in completing goals or are too rigid with expectations of your destiny, reexamine whether your goals, as well as your timetables to achieve them, are realistic.  Setting "stretch goals"-goals that push you a bit beyond what you think you can do; however, they are not out of reach-can be healthy; however, if your expectations are too high, frustration and unnecessary stress can result.</li> <br/>
	
<li>In addition, an effective goal setter understands the importance of setting the right goals.  Two issues to consider here are: </li> <br/>
	

<li>Setting the right goals means that you are setting goals in all areas of your life -- you're addressing the needs of your whole person.  For example, those who set goals related only to their careers often turn into workaholics whose family life and personal health suffer in their quest to achieve their work-related goals.  Do you have goals in all of the following categories?</li> <br/>

<li>Career</li>
<li>Education/personal development</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Physical</li>
<li>Social</li>
<li>Spiritual</li><br/>


<li>Setting the right goals focuses not only on getting the goal accomplished on time, but also on doing it well.  Sacrificing quality for quantity often leads to, at best, a mediocre result.
</li>
<br/><br/>
Too much emphasis on achieving your goals can lead to inflexibility.  Life is full of interruptions that can disrupt your plans.  Being ruled by your goals can lead to anger and frustration with the people and circumstances that get you off track.  Learn to accept that you won't always be able to pursue your goals on your own timetable.  Instead, use your goals to help you get refocused once you've taken care of the unexpected.<br/><br/>
	
Finally, those who are best at setting and achieving their goals know the importance of effective time management skills.  Here are some time management tips specifically targeted to Red personality types:

<li>Connect with others emotionally and socially.  They'll be more cooperative in helping you accomplish your agenda.</li>
<li>Praise and promote the positive in others.  Critical attitudes and behaviors can create fear, driving people to the crisis reaction.</li>
<li>Relax.  Being too demanding doesn't breed confidence or quality.</li>
<li>Set goals for yourself that you can achieve with your strong discipline.  Set different goals and accept different styles when dealing with teams.</li>
<li>Don't blame others who fail to meet commitments.</li>
<li>Think your problems through and seek others' advice when organizing your life.</li>
<li>Be open to suggestions.  Brainstorming with others will save you time and improve others' morale.</li>
<li>Be careful about imposing your demands on others' time.  You don't want them to feel invalidated in meeting their own agendas.</li>

In a team situation when others play a role in determining whether your goals are accomplished, remember that individuals who've had a part in determining group goals tend to have a greater stake in seeing that they are accomplished than they do when others dictate the goals to them.<br/><br/>
	
Finally, those who are best at setting and achieving their goals know the importance of effective time management skills.  Here are some time management tips specifically targeted to Blue personality types:


<li>Think rationally rather than reactively when pressured.</li>
<li>Clearly state your limits when others impose deadlines on you.</li>
<li>Perfectionism narrows your focus, so you ignore other important aspects of your life.</li>
<li>Don't set unrealistic expectations for yourself or others so everyone feels overwhelmed.  See goals as road markers rather than criteria of success.</li>
<li>Don't personalize your interactions with others.  Focus on the task at hand rather than becoming discouraged or critical.</li>
<li>See time management as a compromise rather than "all or nothing."  It will free you to be more creative and less self-critical.</li>
<li>Realize that there are limits to what you can control.  You cannot control other people.</li>
<li>Live in the present and do what you can do, not what you can't control.</li><br/>

Although you see the benefit to goals, you will need to make those goals meaningful to you in order for you to follow through with the process of setting and achieving goals.  Here are some ideas to help you improve your goal-setting skills.<br/><br/>

You're the one who has to believe that goal setting is a skill that will help you succeed before you'll be able to be consistent in using the skill.  Here's a convincing bit of evidence:<br/><br/>
	
<i>A 1953 Yale University study found that only 3 percent of the graduating seniors practiced goal setting regularly, 10 percent used some of the goal-setting principles, and 87 percent didn't practice goal setting at all.  Twenty years later a follow-up study of the career and financial success of the members of that same class revealed that the 3 percent who regularly practiced goal setting accomplished more than the remaining 97 percent combined.</i><br/><br/>
	
Somehow the act of committing goals to paper instead of just saying, "Someday, I'll . . ." or "Sometime I'd like to . . . " moves an idea from being just a dream that's unlikely to ever happen to a goal that has greater chance of becoming reality.  Here are the components of an effective goal statement built around the acronym SMART:

<li><b>S</b>pecific:  State exactly what you want to accomplish.</li>
<li><b>M</b>easurable:  State what you want to accomplish in measurable terms so you will know when you've reached the goal.  For example, you should avoid words like maximize or improve, or some, or try to do better, because you won't really know if and when you've reached your goal.</li>
<li><b>A</b>ction-oriented:  Describe the actions you will need to take in order to achieve your goal.</li>
<li><b>R</b>ealistic, yet challenging:  Choose motivating and stimulating goals that, when achieved, will give you a sense of pride and build your confidence.</li>
<li><b>T</b>imely:  If you say you would like to do something "someday," it will more than likely never happen.  If you say you will have the goal achieved by next Tuesday or some other specific time frame, you will be much more likely to reach your goal.</li><br/>

Here is an example of a SMART goal statement written by a full-time college student who lives in a dormitory on campus and has a part-time job:  <b>I will increase my savings account</b> (<i>specific</i>) <b>by depositing into my bank account</b> (<i>action-oriented</i>) <b>20 percent of my paycheck</b> (<i>measurable</i>) <b>beginning this Friday for the next eight weeks</b> (<i>timely</i>) <b>so I'll have enough money to pay for my auto insurance when it comes due</b> (<i>realistic, yet challenging</i>).<br/>


<li>Because individuals who've had a part in determining their own goals tend to have a greater stake in seeing that they are accomplished than they do when others dictate the goals to them, you need to understand the importance of setting your own goals.  If you've determined your own goals, you will not be likely to see the goals as demanding or restrictive because you're deciding what you want to accomplish based on what is important to you.</li> <br/><br/>
	
<li>Meaningful goals should include attention to all areas of your life-so that you're addressing the needs of your whole person.  For example, those who set goals related only to their careers often turn into workaholics whose family life and personal health suffer in their quest to achieve their work-related goals.  Do you have goals in all of the following categories?</li>
	
<li>Career</li>
<li>Education/personal development</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Physical</li>
<li>Social</li>
<li>Spiritual</li>
<br/>

Start by choosing one area from the preceding list and writing a SMART goal statement.  When you successfully accomplish something that is important to you, you can go through the process again using another area from the list.<br/><br/>

<li>Setting the right goals focuses not only on getting the goal accomplished on time, but also on doing it well.  Sacrificing quality for quantity often leads to, at best, a mediocre result.
</li> <br/>
Finally, those who are best at setting and achieving their goals know the importance of effective time management skills.  Here are some time management tips specifically targeted to White personality types:

<li>State how you feel and what you perceive about yourself, current tasks, and others' behaviors.</li>
<li>Empower yourself by addressing issues rather than avoiding them.</li>
<li>See conflict as enriching.  Share your ideas and seek others' input.</li>
<li>Seek a sense of urgency.  White can miss living passionate lives by refusing to get excited about projects and people.</li>
<li>Set proactive agendas rather than reacting to agendas others set for you.</li>
<li>Don't be overly defensive when others seem demanding.  Focus on "what" is being said rather than "how" it is being said.</li>
<li>Risk a little.  Set goals that require effort and build confidence rather than taking a "wait and see" attitude.</li>
<li>Make the effort to control daydreams, which rob you of valuable time to get legitimate work done.</li><br/>

Because you tend to prefer to play today rather than set goals for tomorrow, you are likely to benefit from these ideas on how to improve your goal-setting skills:<br/><br/>

No matter what others say about the importance of goal setting, you're ultimately the one who has to believe that goal setting is a skill that will help you succeed before you'll be able to exercise the discipline it takes to use this skill.  Here's a convincing bit of evidence:
<br/><br/>
	
<i>A 1953 Yale University study found that only 3 percent of the graduating seniors practiced goal setting regularly, 10 percent used some of the goal-setting principles, and 87 percent didn't practice goal setting at all.  Twenty years later a follow-up study of the career and financial success of the members of that same class revealed that the 3 percent who regularly practiced goal setting accomplished more than the remaining 97 percent combined.</i><br/><br/>

This research seems to support the old adage, "If you aim at nothing, you'll be sure to hit it."  See what ideas you can take from the following discussion to help you improve your aim.<br/><br/>
	
Somehow the act of committing goals to paper instead of just saying, "Someday, I'll . . ." or "Sometime I'd like to . . . " moves an idea from being just a dream that's unlikely to ever happen to a goal that has greater chance of becoming reality.  Here are the components of an effective goal statement built around the acronym SMART:
<br/>

<li><b>S</b>pecific:  State exactly what you want to accomplish.</li>
<li><b>M</b>easurable:  State what you want to accomplish in measurable terms so you will know when you've reached the goal.  For example, you should avoid words like maximize or improve, or some, or try to do better, because you won't really know if and when you've reached your goal.</li>
<li><b>A</b>ction-oriented:  Describe the actions you will need to take in order to achieve your goal.</li>
<li><b>R</b>ealistic, yet challenging:  Choose motivating and stimulating goals that, when achieved, will give you a sense of pride and build your confidence.</li>
<li><b>T</b>imely:  If you say you would like to do something "someday," it will more than likely never happen.  If you say you will have the goal achieved by next Tuesday or some other specific time frame, you will be much more likely to reach your goal.</li><br/>

Finally, those who are best at setting and achieving their goals know the importance of effective time management skills.  Here are some time management tips specifically targeted to Yellow personality types:

<li>Realize that "busyness" is not necessarily the same as purposeful action.  Give what is truly important the legitimate attention it deserves.</li>
<li>Set specific goals each day and prioritize them.</li>
<li>Focus on "what is necessary" rather than "what's fun."  Quality requires both.</li>
<li>Set achievable "time bits" where you focus on a specific task for a specific amount of time and reward yourself for sticking to it.</li>
<li>Commit to the bigger picture.  Create a long-term plan of substance and seek specific activities you can complete to make it a reality.</li>
<li>Balance undemanding creativity with focused commitments.</li>
<li>Do a little planning up front so you "get it right" the first time.</li>
<li>Listen well so you don't have to interrupt others for information already presented.</li><br/>
