The Color Code Test
===

Now Available for the Mighty Commandline!
---

This is a simple commandline questionaire that asks the questions from The Color Code in random order and the answers also randomized.

The is particularly useful for people like myself who have pre-conceived notions about their personality and want to take the test in a less-biased fashion.

    npm install -g color-code
    color-code

Upon completion of the test, the results are saved in a JSON file (the path to which is printed to the screen).

Warning
===

I nabbed the questions from http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/buildyourmanagementskills/updated_flash/topic5d/quiz_radio.xml which I found in a google search, and without permission of the author.

Enough people have created online versions of this test that I hope this not to be an issue.
